#contribution:

here’s a complete, ready-to-execute plan to make a small but meaningful contribution to LogChimp by opening a PR to improve their “Install from Source” docs. This hits exactly what your prompt asks for: explore the codebase/docs, spot concrete improvements, implement them, and communicate the reasoning.

What we’ll change (scope of the PR)
Target: the documentation page “Install from Source.”
Why this page: It contains a few correctness & clarity issues that are easy to fix yet valuable for new contributors.

Issues found
Outdated / brittle Node.js prerequisite.
The page says “Node.js (v12)” which is both EOL and can drift from the repo’s chosen runtime. A better source of truth is the repo’s .nvmrc (present at the repo root), so docs should tell contributors to use the version pinned in .nvmrc rather than hard-coding v12. 
GitHub

Incorrect Docker port flag for Postgres.
The page shows -p 5432 which exposes a random high host port; for local development you want a stable mapping -p 5432:5432. 
LogChimp

Brand capitalization of pnpm.
It’s written “pNpm,” the correct brand spelling is pnpm. 
LogChimp

Small clarity boosts.

Show nvm use right before pnpm install so newcomers actually get the right Node version.

Mention that the codebase is split into server and theme workspaces (which the docs allude to), and keep the “two terminals” run commands as-is.

Concrete edits (what to put in your commit)
The docs live in this repo under /content/. Search for the file that renders the Install from Source page (slug /install/source/). It will likely be something like:

content/install/source.mdx or

content/install/source/index.mdx
(use GitHub’s repo search for the phrase “Install from Source”.)

Patch (unified diff you can adapt to the actual path)

-## Prerequisites
-
-Before getting started, you'll need these global packages installed:
-
-  * Node.js (v12) - the easiest way to install is via nvm
-  * pNpm - for managing dependencies
-  * PostgreSQL (v12) - PostgreSQL database
-
-You can read more about the engine requirements from the package.json on GitHub.
+## Prerequisites
+
+Before getting started, install the following:
+
+  * **Node.js (use the version in `.nvmrc`)** – the easiest way is via **nvm**
+  * **pnpm** – for managing workspace dependencies
+  * **PostgreSQL 12+** – local database for development
+
+> Tip: using the version from `.nvmrc` keeps your local setup aligned with the repository.

Why these changes are safe & useful

They remove a stale Node version and point contributors to the single source of truth (.nvmrc). 
GitHub

They fix an actual connection bug in the Docker example (-p 5432:5432). 
LogChimp

They align naming and add a commonly-missed step (nvm use) to prevent version mismatch errors. 
LogChimp

They reinforce the server/theme split reflected in the architecture.

How to implement & submit (step-by-step)
Fork & clone

gh repo fork logchimp/logchimp --clone
cd logchimp
Create a branch

git checkout -b docs/fix-install-from-source
Find the page file

On GitHub, press t to open file finder and search for install/source.

Or use code search for the string Node.js (v12) to locate the exact file.

Apply the patch

Edit the file as per the diff above (path may vary under /content/…).

Build or at least lint docs locally (optional)

nvm use
pnpm install
# If there is a docs build or typecheck script, run it (e.g., pnpm run build:docs)
Commit & push

git add .
git commit -m "docs: fix Postgres port mapping, use .nvmrc for Node version, standardize pnpm, add nvm use"
git push -u origin docs/fix-install-from-source
Open the PR

Title: docs: fix install-from-source (Node via .nvmrc, pnpm casing, Postgres port)

PR body (use this template):

### Summary
Small docs improvements on /install/source:

- Replace hard-coded “Node.js (v12)” with “use the version in `.nvmrc`”
- Standardize “pnpm” capitalization
- Correct Postgres Docker example to `-p 5432:5432` and add a named volume
- Add `nvm use` before `pnpm install`
- Clarify two-terminal setup (server + theme)

### Motivation
- Keeps runtime aligned with repository config (`.nvmrc`) and avoids EOL Node. 
- Corrects the Postgres port mapping so the app can reliably connect on localhost.
- Reduces onboarding friction for first-time contributors.

### References
- Docs page being updated: Install from Source
- Project architecture (server + theme): Architecture docs

### Impact
Docs-only change; no runtime behavior. Improves local setup reliability for new contributors.
How this demonstrates your approach
Exploration: You read the official docs & repo layout (server/theme, .nvmrc, pnpm workspaces). 
GitHub
LogChimp

Insight: You identified correctness issues (Docker port), maintenance smell (hard-coded Node), and wording tweaks. 
LogChimp

Communication: Your PR body explains what, why, and impact crisply, and links to authoritative pages.

Stretch ideas (optional follow-ups after this PR)
Add a short “Dev quickstart” block in README.md that links to the install page and shows:

nvm use && pnpm install
pnpm --filter @logchimp/server dev    # terminal 1
pnpm --filter @logchimp/theme dev     # terminal 2
(Match the actual workspace names once you confirm them in pnpm-workspace.yaml.) 
GitHub

Open a separate PR to the docs to add a Troubleshooting section (e.g., common Postgres connection errors).

If you want, I can also draft the exact Git commit for you once you paste the path of the file that backs /install/source/.
